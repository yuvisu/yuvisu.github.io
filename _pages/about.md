I am currently a Postdoc associate in the Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics at University of Florida, working with [Prof. Dr. Jiang Bian](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/bian-jiang/). My research interests center around the intersections of machine learning, real-world data analysis and clinical informatics.

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in 2022. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dr. Vincent S. Tseng](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~vtseng/) and [Prof. Dr. Gary G. Yen](https://isc.okstate.edu/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology. 

My Ph.D. dissertation is "A Study on Early Time Series Classification Methodologies with Applications in Cardiovascular Disease Detection", examined by [Prof. Dr. Ming-Syan Chen](http://arbor.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~mschen/), [Prof. Dr. Shou-De Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/), [Prof. Dr. Hung-Yu Kao](https://ikmlab.csie.ncku.edu.tw/advisor.html), [Prof. Dr. Wen-Chih Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/wcpeng/) and [Prof. Dr. Jiun-Long Huang](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~jlhuang/). My research interests includes machine learning for EHR data analysis, temporal data and time series processing, fairness machine learning, and digital twin. More specifically, I am interested in developing fair data-driven methods, including machine learning and deep learning, for solving real-world medical problems.
