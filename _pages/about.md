I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science at the Indiana University School of Medicine and an [investigator at the Clem McDonald Center for Biomedical Informatics, Regenstrief Institute](https://www.regenstrief.org/person/yu-huang/).  My research focuses on several key areas: (1) AI-driven models for health outcome and disease progression research, (2) fair machine learning using real-world data (RWD) to promote health equity, (3) innovative deep learning techniques for temporal and spatial temporal data analysis, and (4) multi-modal data modeling and analysis.

I received my Postdoc training in the Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics at University of Florida, working with [Prof. Dr. Jiang Bian](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/bian-jiang/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in 2022. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dr. Vincent S. Tseng](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~vtseng/) and [Prof. Dr. Gary G. Yen](https://isc.okstate.edu/).  My Ph.D. dissertation is "A Study on Early Time Series Classification Methodologies with Applications in Cardiovascular Disease Detection", examined by [Prof. Dr. Ming-Syan Chen](http://arbor.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~mschen/), [Prof. Dr. Shou-De Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/), [Prof. Dr. Hung-Yu Kao](https://ikmlab.csie.ncku.edu.tw/advisor.html), [Prof. Dr. Wen-Chih Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/wcpeng/) and [Prof. Dr. Jiun-Long Huang](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~jlhuang/).  Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology.
