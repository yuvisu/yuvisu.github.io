Arrhythmia detection from ECG is an important research subject in the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The prevailing studies formulate arrhythmia detection from ECG as a time series classification problem. Meanwhile, early detection of arrhythmia presents a real-world demand for early prevention and diagnosis. In this paper, we address a problem of cardiovascular diseases early classification, which is a varied-length and long-length time series early classification problem as well.
