The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in health care to aid clinical decisions is widespread. However, as AI and ML take important roles in health care, there are concerns about AI and ML associated fairness and bias. That is, an AI tool may have a disparate impact, with its benefits and drawbacks unevenly distributed across societal strata and subpopulations, potentially exacerbating existing health inequities. Thus, the objectives of this scoping review were to summarize existing literature and identify gaps in the topic of tackling algorithmic bias and optimizing fairness in AI/ML models using real-world data (RWD) in health care domains.
