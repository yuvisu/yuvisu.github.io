Early time series classification predicts the class label of a given time series before it is completely observed. In time-critical applications, such as arrhythmia monitoring in ICU, early treatment contributes to the patientâ€™s fast recovery, and early warning could even save lives. Hence, in these cases, it is worthy of trading, to some extent, classification accuracy in favor of earlier decisions when the time series data are collected over time. In this article, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based framework, snippet policy network V2 (SPN-V2), for long and varied-length multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) early classification.
