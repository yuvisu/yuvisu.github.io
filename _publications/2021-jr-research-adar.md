The incidence of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic rhinitis (AR) is increasing. This warrants development of measures to predict and prevent these conditions. We aimed to investigate the predictive ability of a spectrum of data mining methods to predict childhood AD and AR using longitudinal birth cohort data. We conducted a 14-year follow-up of infants born to pregnant women who had undergone maternal examinations at nine selected maternity hospitals across Taiwan during 2000â€“2005.
