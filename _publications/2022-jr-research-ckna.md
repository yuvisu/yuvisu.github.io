Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are considered the greatest threat to human life according to World Health Organization. Early classification of CVDs and the appropriate follow-up treatment are crucial for preventing sudden deaths. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most common non-invasive tools used to evaluate the state of the heart, which can be exploited to automatically diagnose as well. However, the importance of diagnosing CVDs is varying in different context-specific scenarios....
