title: "Imaging Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease using Retinal Images from Real-World Data"
excerpt: "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), accounting for 80% of dementia cases, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognition, among other neurobehavioral symptoms. "

This is study aims at (a) developing a phenotyping tools to create a research-grade AD RWD cohort and novel graph neural network (GNN) techniques to identify AD progression pathways, (2) developing novel retinal imaging biomarker of AD and assess the longitudinal association of retinal vasculature changes with AD disease progression.
